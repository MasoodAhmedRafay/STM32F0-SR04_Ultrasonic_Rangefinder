STM32F0-SR04_Ultrasonic_Rangefinder
===================================

A pretty simple CooCox project to interface the SR04 ultrasonic sensor, normally found ridiculously cheap on eBay! It uses the CooCox debug functionality to read the distance and uses a blocking function that could easily be modified to be unblocking! Uses all standard pins and peripherals available on the STM32F0 Discovery.
